 * Revision 1.5  2003/02/24 00:13:51  wurp
 * Formatted all java code for cvs (strictSunConvention.xml)
 * 
 * Revision 1.4  2001/06/20 04:05:42  wurp
 * added log4j.
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  2001/01/28 07:52:20  wurp
 * Removed <dollar> from Id and Log in log comments.
 * Added several new commands to AdminApp
 * Unfortunately, several other changes that I have lost track of.  Try diffing this
 * version with the previous one.
 * 
 * Revision 1.2  2000/12/16 22:07:33  wurp
 * Added Id and Log to almost all of the files that didn't have it.  It's
 * possible that the script screwed something up.  I did a commit and an update
 * right before I ran the script, so if a file is screwed up you should be able
 * to fix it by just going to the version before this one.
