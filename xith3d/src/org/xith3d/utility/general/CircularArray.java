 * Java's internal LinkedList implementation is extremely GC expensive.
 * This Array-embedded implemention is better.<br>
 * The CircularArray is a special kind of a Stack. Elements are dropped in (push)
 * in the array at a certain position and are removed (pop) at another certain position.
 * These position are generally not the backing array's first and last positions,
 * but can be anywhere. When the array's last element has been written, the array's
 * first element will be the next and so forth.
 * So the position of an element in the backing array is (i % array.length).
