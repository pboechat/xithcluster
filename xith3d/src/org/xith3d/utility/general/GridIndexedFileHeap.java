 * :Log: GridIndexedFileHeap.java,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2003/02/24 00:13:51  wurp
 * Formatted all java code for cvs (strictSunConvention.xml)
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/06/20 04:05:42  wurp
 * added log4j.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/01/28 07:52:19  wurp
 * Removed <dollar> from Id and Log in log comments.
 * Added several new commands to AdminApp
 * Unfortunately, several other changes that I have lost track of.  Try diffing this
 * version with the previous one.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/12/16 22:07:33  wurp
 * Added Id and Log to almost all of the files that didn't have it.  It's
 * possible that the script screwed something up.  I did a commit and an update
 * right before I ran the script, so if a file is screwed up you should be able
 * to fix it by just going to the version before this one.

/**
 * Generic utility class that indexes a random access file by a grid tree.  It is
 * extremely fast for grid style lookups and handles sparse data very well.  The leafs can
 * be an arbitrary sized data chunks.
 *
 * Manages an indexed file heap.
 * For example if you have a granularity of 10, depth of 4 and leafSize of 20 you can
 * index a grid of 10^4 * 20 by 10^4 * 20, or 200,000 x 200,2000  This means you can retrieve
 * a data handle for the data stored at x,z = (0..n,0..n) where N is 200k with 4 key node
 * retrievals.  If there is no data at that leaf then it could require less actual key
 * traversals since the key children might be null if that entire sub-tree is empty.
 *
 * In the above example each key node will be a 10x10 array of children pointers, where
 * any pointer can be null, indicating there is no data below that part of the tree.  The
 * storage is most efficient for sparse data.  In the pathalogical case of every possible
 * leaf being stored, the indexing overhead would probably surpass the stored data, and since
 * it could have been stored in a contiguous array with offsets being easily calculated, this
 * results in possibly an extremely inefficient usage. Note for these cases it is far better to
 * use a tree of depth one, so at least you can make use of the file heap and buffering, even
 * if the indexing no longer buys you anything.
 *
 * An example of this would be terrain heightmaps.  If some large percentage of the world
 * is unknown, or is water, you will realize some nice saves in storage, while retaining the
 * ability to load chunks of heightmaps quickly and with buffering.
 *
 * In the case of landscape details like trees and rocks, these can be fairly sparse and you can
 * easily have
 *
 * You can also request all non-null children for a range of (x1,z1) .. (x2,z2) and expect
 * extremely fast retrievals.
