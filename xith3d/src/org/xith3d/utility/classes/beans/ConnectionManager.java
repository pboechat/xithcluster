 * The Great ConnectionManager is the master of all modularity :)

 * in your game. Well, create a float interpolator (and configure it
 * correctly). Then connect the angle of your door with this
 * interpolator. Now every time you adjust your interpolator
 * (setAlpha method) your door will have the corresponding angle..
