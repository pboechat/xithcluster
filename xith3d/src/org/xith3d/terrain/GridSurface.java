/**
 * <p>
 * A <code>GridSurface</code> is used to "prepare" a given rectangular region of a regular grid.
 * This means an implementation provides an {@link Appearance} instance and appropriate texture
 * coordinates for the area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To enable effective data storage for LOD rendering of large scale landscapes, the
 * <code>prepare()</code> method accepts a detail argument specifying the needed resolution of the
 * generated <code>Appearance</code> (respectively for textures).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The values of the detail argument have no strict meaning other than a value of 0 requests the
 * most detailed resolution, the {@link GridSampler} implementation has to offer. Higher numbers are
 * for less detailed data resolutions. A detail-level of 0 requests the lowest available resolution.
 * Typically (depends on the overall setup) a detail-level of 2 requests the highest available
 * resolution.
