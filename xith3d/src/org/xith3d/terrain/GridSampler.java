/**
 * A GridSampler is used to retrieve height values from a regular grid.
 *
 * A grid is defined as rectangular area with coordinates [s,t] ranging from
 * [0,0] to [1,1]. The values stored in the grid range from 0 to 1.
 * 
 * The GridSampler is normally used by a triangulator, that generates the triangle
 * representation of the grid. To enable effective data storage for LOD rendering
 * of large scale landscapes, the prepare() method accept a detail argument specifying
 * the needed resolution for the triangulation.
 * 
 * The values of the detail argument have no strict meaning other than a value 
 * of 0 requests the most detailed resolution, the GridSampler implementation
 * has to offer. Higher numbers are for less detailed data resolutions. A detail-level
 * of 0 requests the lowest available resolution. Typically (depends on the overall setup)
 * a detail-level of 2 requests the highest available resolution.
