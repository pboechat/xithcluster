/**
 * An overlay is 3d geometry which is aligned with the image plate.  This is
 * designed to be as simple as possible for the developer to use.  All that is
 * needed is to extend this class and override the paint function to update the
 * image which will be written displayed on the screen.
 *
 * As a note: Displaying large overlays can use a *huge* amount of texture memory.
 * If you created a pane which was 1024x768 you would consume over 3 mb of texture memory.
 *
 * Another thing to realize is that textures have to be a power of two.  Because of this
 * an overlay which was 513 x 257 would normally have to be generated using 1024 x 512.  Unlike
 * most textures, overlays cannot tolerate stretching and interpolation because of the fuzzyness
 * which would result.  So what the Xith overlay system attempts to do is break the overlay up
 * into small pieces so that extra texture memory is not wasted.  You are given a canvas which
 * represents the entire overlay.  After you finish updating it, the image is ripped apart and
 * written to the underlying textures.  Each of these underlying textures are double-buffered,
 * so that switching them to the Xith3d engine is quick and does not involve having to continuously
 * allocate and free large BufferedImages.  This means, of course, that for every overlay you
 * use 3 times (width * height * 4bytes) of system memory.  So a chatbox which was 512 x 200
 * would use 3 * ( 512 * 200 *4) bytes or 1.2 MB of system memory.
 *
 * Updates to the actual textures are done within a behavior within a frame.  This is very
 * fast because all that is happening is that the buffers are getting swapped.
 * We have to be certain that we are not in the process of copying the big buffer into the back
 * buffer at the same time the behavior attempts to do a buffer swap. This is handled by the
 * overlay by not updating texture if we are in the middle of drawing a new one.
 * The drawback to this is that numerous updates per second to the overlay could result in
 * several updates not get immediately reflected.  But since the area is always completely
 * redrawn this should not prove to be an issue.  Soon as we hit a frame where we are not updating
 * the buffer then it will be swapped.
 *
 * Remember, all you have to do to make translucent or non-square overlays is
 * to use the alpha channel.
