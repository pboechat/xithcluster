<b>NOTE:  There are currently no developers maintaining or supporting this package.</b>

<p>
the swing userinterface package for Xith3D was created by David Yazel and released on 2003-10-05. What it provides is a way to use Swing from within Xith3D, where the widgets are drawn using OpenGL inside the window instead of being in a seperate frame. Amongst other things, this allows for nice transparency effects for example. Swing is incredibly versatile as a UI toolkit, allowing the developer to create custom skins and components. It isn't generally regarded as a "high-performance" UI toolkit partly due to the overhead this versatility brings, but as it is very powerful, the trade-off is worth considering.
