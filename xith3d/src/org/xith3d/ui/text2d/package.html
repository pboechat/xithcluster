<p><b>Dynamic Text for Xith (DTX)</b></p>

<p>
	As there is no ( or no dynamic ) text node for xith3d here is mine.
	
	While the Text2D version org.xith3d.text.Text2D by Terje Wiesener uses a single face with a static texture
 	this class uses a seperate Shape3d for every char it uses. Those shapes are stored in a static HashMap to prevent
 	some load when using many text objects.
  
 	<ul>features:
 		<li>fast text and color changes</li>
 		<li>multiline support</li>
 		<li>horizontal and vertical text aligning</li>
 		<li>Java2D font support</li>
 	</ul>
	
	Thanks to Terje Wiesener ( who wrote the other Text2D implementation ), i borrowed the render stuff from his work :)
</p>

<p>
	<b>Usage:</b>
	usage should be fairly simple:
	just create a Text2D object and put it somewhere into your scenegraph
	for more information see the Text2D class javadoc ... i believe the method names and javadoc is easy to understand
</p>

 	<b>Changelog:</b>
 	<p>
 	    1.1f: third version of DTX 
 	    <ul>
