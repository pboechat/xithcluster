     * Ok this is a little tricky. When a state trackable item comes in, we
     * check to see if there is a state node already assigned. If there is then

     * unique object, but probably is the same as one we have already seen.
     * <p>
     * So we take the item and use it as a key into a TreeMap. The state
     * trackable items have to implement Comparable, so we we can use it as a
     * key. Now this can be expensive since some shader components have many
     * sub-items which will have to be compared. But if the comparators are
     * written properly we can quickly match against the tree state in log(n)
     * compares, which is very few.
     * <p>
     * If we find and entry then we just assign that state node to the state
     * trackable item. If we do not then we create a new node. This node copies
     * the statetrackable item, assigns it a unique id and inserts it into the
     * tree.
