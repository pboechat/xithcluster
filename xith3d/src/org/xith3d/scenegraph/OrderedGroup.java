 * 
 * <p>1. All transparent shapes are drawn in a seperate pass and drawn back 
 * to front ignoring ordering in ordered groups.
 * <p>2. If a shape is transparent, but marked with setSortEnabled(false) then 
 * the shape will be drawn in the opaque pass without respect to its back-to-front order.
 * <p>3. If a shape is transparent, marked for non-sorting with setSortEnabled(false) and a child in an 
 * ordered group then the ordering of the shapes will be first by ordered group 
 * and second by standard rendering attributes.
