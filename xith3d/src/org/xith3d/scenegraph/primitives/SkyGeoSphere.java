/**
 * A sky box is background node intended to display the sky with a far away
 * appearance but without consuming massive computational resources. It is drawn
 * with the depth buffer disabled, so all objects which are drawn after it will
 * be drawn in front. Even though it respects View's angle, it will always be
 * drawn as if the View (camera) were in its center regardless of the actual
 * position.
 * <p>
 * This implementation creates a sphere to provide a more realistic sky than
 * SkyBox. The downside to using a sphere is that you need a panoramic picture
 * to use as the Texture. This implementation also uses GeoSphere geometry so
 * that it doesn't create a ridiculous number of triangles.
 * <p>
 * This class ignores the default setting for pickable and sets itself to NOT
 * pickable.  You must explicitly call setPickable( true ) on SkyGeoSphere
 * nodes regardless of the default setting.
 * <p>
 * Originally inspired by William Denniss's SkyBox.
