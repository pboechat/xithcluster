/**
 * With JointLimitMotor limits can be attached to Joints,
 * but also motor-like behaviour.
 * <br><br>
 * If you want to use the limit functionality of JointLimitMotor,
 * you have to set lostop and histop.
 * <br><br>
 * If you want to use it as a motor, you have to set vel and fmax, where
 * <br> vel is the speed to which the Joint should reach
 * <br> fmax is the force that maximally can be applied to reach this target,
 * by default this is zero, so setting vel alone does not suffice.
 * 
 * Joints, where limits and motor functionality are possible have a field(s)
 * containing the JointLimitMotor, so as a user you won't have to call the
 * constructor yourself.
