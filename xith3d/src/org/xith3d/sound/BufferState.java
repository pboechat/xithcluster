/**
 * A Buffer encapsulates state related to storing sample data. The application can
 * request and release Buffer objects, and fill them with data. Data can be supplied
 * compressed and encoded as long as the format is supported. Buffers can, internally,
 * contain waveform data as uncompressed or compressed samples,
 *
 * Unlike Sources and Listener, Buffer Objects can be shared among contexts. Buffers are
 * referenced by Sources. A single Buffer can be referred to by multiple Sources. This
 * separation allows driver and hardware to optimize storage and processing where applicable.
 *
 * The simplest supported format for buffer data is PCM.
 * The Buffer state is dependent on the state of all Sources that is has been
 * queued for. A single queue occurrence of a Buffer propagates the Buffer state
 * (over all Sources) from UNUSED to PROCESSED or higher. Sources that are STOPPED or
 * INITIAL still have queue entries that cause Buffers to be PROCESSED.
 *
 * A single queue entry with a single Source for which the Buffer is not yet
 * PROCESSED propagates the buffer's queueing state to PENDING.
 *
 * Buffers that are PROCESSED for a given Source can be unqueued from that
 * Source's queue. Buffers that have been unqueued from all Sources are UNUSED.
 * Buffers that are UNUSED can be deleted, or changed by BufferData commands.
