# xithcluster

**xithcluster** is an extention to the Java scene graph library [Xith3D](http://xith.org/).

It's a complete solution to distribute rendering between multiple computers using a method called sort-last.

Developed as my final graduation project.

Published in the 8th Brazilian Virtual and Augmented Reality Workshop (WRVA). You can download it [here](http://pedroboechat.com/publications/XithCluster%20-%20Uma%20Biblioteca%20de%20Grafo%20de%20Cena%20Distribu%C3%ADdo.pdf) (available only in Portuguese, unfortunately).
